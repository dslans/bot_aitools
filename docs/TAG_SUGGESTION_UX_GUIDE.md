# Tag Suggestion User Experience Guide

## How Users Discover Entry IDs

### 🎯 **Solution 1: One-Click Suggest Tag Buttons**

When users run `/aitools-list`, each entry now has a **🏷️ Suggest Tag** button that:

1. **Click the button** → Shows an ephemeral prompt with:
   - Tool name and entry ID clearly displayed
   - Ready-to-use command template: `/aitools-suggest-tag abc12345 your-tag`
   - Examples with the actual entry ID pre-filled
   - Guidance on tag formatting

2. **User copies and runs** the command → Immediate tag suggestion creation

**User Flow:**
```
/aitools-list → Click "🏷️ Suggest Tag" → Copy/paste command → Done!
```

### 📋 **Solution 2: Clean Interface Focus**

Entry lists maintain a clean, uncluttered interface:
- **Context line**: `📊 Score: +5` - Simple score display
- **No technical clutter**: Entry IDs hidden since buttons handle access
- **Focus on content**: Users see tool information, not database internals
- **Streamlined experience**: One-click access eliminates need for ID exposure
